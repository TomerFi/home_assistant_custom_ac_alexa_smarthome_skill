Alexa smarthome skill hosted on lambda servers for controlling a custom ac build with Home Assistant controls.
I want to tell you a little bit about the why I decided to create this skill I actually waited along time before I could find the time to work on this project, and it's actually my first alexa smart home skill, I've made a couple of custom skills, but this if my first smart home skil... so forgive me if I seem a bit too excited. ;-)</br>
You can check out the skill in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=Y4i989zwQlc).


## Background
So... I have a couple of IR controlled air-conditioner units that I wanted to make smarter.</br>
The first part was easy, I purchased a [*Broadlink RM Pro*](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Broadlink-RM2-RM-Pro-Smart-home-Automation-Universal-Intelligent-wireless-remote-control-WIFI-IR-RF-switch/32738344424.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.svn7ka) for my living room's ac unit, and a [*Broadling RM Mini*](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Broadlink-RM2-RM-PRO-Smart-Home-Automation-WiFi-IR-RF-Universal-Intelligent-Wireless-remote-Controller-for/32729931353.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.svn7ka) for my bedroom ac.</br>
These devices are actually a smarter universal remote that you can access remotly a create different scenarios for using your various ir/rf devices (only the pro version supports rf), I've been using them for more then a year now and they work great!</br>
For this project I've used my broadlink devices as IR Transmitters. The ir codes management will be handled by home assistant and activated with alexa.
